# How to setup Swarm Learning

The Swarm Learning package contains docker container images for each Swarm Learning component. The Swarm Learning container images are available in a docker registry as described in section [Pulling docker images](#pull-docker-images).

Create login credentials to access [My HPE Software Center (MSC)](https://myenterpriselicense.hpe.com/cwp-ui/evaluation/HPE-SWARM/0.3.0/null) if you donâ€™t have yet. The email address used to access MSC is called as HPE passport account. 

The evaluation license for running the Swarm Learning components are available at [My HPE Software Center (MSC)](https://myenterpriselicense.hpe.com/cwp-ui/evaluation/HPE-SWARM/0.3.0/null). Use your HPE Passport account to access MSC and download evaluation license.

## Pulling docker images

Swarm Learning docker images are available on HPE docker registry - ``hub.myenterpriselicense.hpe.com.`` Docker registry access is password
protected. User needs to login to docker registry using HPE Passport email id and password 'hpe_eval'. All Swarm Learning images are signed by HPE with the name as 'hpe-ai-swarm-learning'. Users can inspect and pull these images after enabling docker content trust by setting the environment variable as 'DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1'. See [resources](URL.md#21-httpsdocsdockercomenginesecuritytrust) for details.

The following Swarm Learning images are available on HPE docker registry:

1.  ``hub.myenterpriselicense.hpe.com/hpe_eval/swarm-learning/apls:0.3.0`` -- this is the docker image for the License Manager component.

2.  ``hub.myenterpriselicense.hpe.com/hpe_eval/swarm-learning/spire-server:0.3.0``-- this is the docker image for the SPIRE Server component.

3.  ``hub.myenterpriselicense.hpe.com/hpe_eval/swarm-learning/sn:0.3.0`` -- this is the docker image for the Swarm Network component.

4.  ``hub.myenterpriselicense.hpe.com/hpe_eval/swarm-learning/sl-tf:0.3.0``-- this is the docker image for the TensorFlow-based Swarm Learning component.

5.  ``hub.myenterpriselicense.hpe.com/hpe_eval/swarm-learning/sl-pyt:0.3.0``-- this is the docker image for the PyTorch-based Swarm Learning component.

6.  ``hub.myenterpriselicense.hpe.com/hpe_eval/swarm-learning/swci:0.3.0`` -- this is the docker image for Swarm Learning Command Interface component.

The steps to be followed to download Swarm Learning docker images on the Linux environment.
    
1. Use HPE Passport email id as username and 'hpe_eval' as password to login to registry
  
       docker login hub.myenterpriselicense.hpe.com -u <HPE-PASSPORT-EMAIL> -p hpe_eval

2. Enable docker content trust
     
       export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1

3. Optionally, inspect repos and validate HPE signer name for all the Swarm Learning images is ``hpe-ai-swarm-learning``
   For example
       
       docker trust inspect --pretty
       
       hub.myenterpriselicense.hpe.com/hpe_eval/swarm-learning/apls

4. Pull all signed images with tag '0.3.0'

       docker pull hub.myenterpriselicense.hpe.com/hpe_eval/swarm-learning/apls:0.3.0
       
       docker pull hub.myenterpriselicense.hpe.com/hpe_eval/swarm-learning/spire-server:0.3.0

       docker pull hub.myenterpriselicense.hpe.com/hpe_eval/swarm-learning/swci:0.3.0

## Installing licenses and starting license server

Licenses for running the Swarm Learning package should be installed on the License Server. After completing the product installation, start the License Server container using the ``swarm-learning/bin/run-apls`` script. The parameters for this script are described in the Running Swarm Learning section. Then, connect to the License Server's management interface using a web browser. This site can be reached using the link, ``-address-or-FQDN-of-host-running-License-Server-container>:5814/autopass``.

The default username is, ``"admin"``, and the password, ``"password"``.

Use the management interface to install licenses and manage them. See chapter "HPE AutoPass License Server License Management" in [AutoPass License Server User Guide](HPE%20AutoPass%20License%20Server%20User%20Guide.pdf).

> NOTE: Whenever the container running the License Server (apls) is stopped or the host system running the License Sever reboots, the  License Server needs to be started and the licenses have to be reinstalled again. 
> HPE recommends not to stop the License Server container once it is started.                                                           

## Uninstalling the Swarm Learning package

Use the ``swarm-learning/bin/uninstall`` script to uninstall the Swarm Learning package. This script does not accept any command line parameters. It should be run on every node where Swarm Learning package was installed.

When run, it stops all Swarm Learning components that are running on that host, removes the docker container images, and deletes the "docs", "examples" and "scripts" directories installed under swarm-learning.

>NOTE: If needed, any log output produced by the containers should be saved before invoking the script as they will not be available     after the script is executed. Also output files that have been written under the "examples" directory by previous runs might also       require attention.
